Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python (3.8 or higher recommended)
Django
Redis
Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository:

:-git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git
cd project-name
Install Dependencies:It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Create and activate a virtual environment, then install the required packages using pip.



:-python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Unix/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Up Redis:Ensure Redis is installed and running on your system. You can start the Redis server using:



:-redis-server
Apply Database Migrations:Apply migrations to set up the database schema.



:-python manage.py migrate
Load Excel Data into Redis:Run the custom management command to process and store Excel data into Redis.



:-python manage.py process_excel_data
This command reads data from data/path_to_excel.csv, sorts it by timestamp, and stores it in Redis.
The Excel data file path (data/path_to_excel.csv) is configurable in the command implementation.
The command reads the Excel data, sorts it based on timestamp (sts column), and stores the latest device information (latitude, longitude, timestamp) in Redis using hashes (hmset).
Run the Django Development Server:Start the Django development server to serve the API endpoints.

:-python manage.py runserver

Access API Endpoints:Once the server is running, you can access the following API endpoints:
Latest device information:

:-GET http://localhost:8000/latest/{device_id}/

Device start and end locations:
:-GET http://localhost:8000/location/{device_id}/

Device location points within a time range:
:-GET http://localhost:8000/location/{device_id}/{start_time}/{end_time}/

Additional Notes
Ensure that the Redis configuration in settings.py matches your Redis server settings (REDIS_HOST, REDIS_PORT, REDIS_DB).
Make sure to configure ALLOWED_HOSTS in settings.py for production use.
Update any placeholders (e.g., project-name, yourusername, data/path_to_excel.csv) with your specific project details.
